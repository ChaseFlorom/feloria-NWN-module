# The Frozen North

This repository contains all the module content and associated files for The Frozen North, a Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition persistent world.

There's a little more information in the [wiki](https://github.com/b5635/the-frozen-north/wiki), so please check it out for some additional information, including a player's guide to the server as well as for builders. Currently WIP.

[nasher.nim](https://github.com/squattingmonk/nasher.nim) is required to build the module.

You will also need NWNX:EE to host the server. I used [Daz's guide](https://github.com/Daztek/NWNX-WSL) for the development server.

Feel free to hop in to the [Discord](https://discord.gg/qKqRUDZ) if you have any questions.
